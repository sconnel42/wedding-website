      <p>
        As a result of the ongoing health crisis, we have made the difficult decision to postpone
        part of our wedding until next year. We will be hosting a small wedding ceremony on our original day,
        October 10th, 2020, though it'll be smaller than we would have liked due to current restrictions in
        the size of gatherings in the state of Illinois. However, we plan on recording the mass in some fashion,
        and will make that available for people who want to watch it. In addition, we will be postponing our
        reception until next year, which will now take place on Saturday, October 30th, 2021. We want to make sure
        that we do our best to keep everyone safe and healthy, which we don't think would be possible if we had the
        reception this year. These are difficult and confusing times, so if you have any questions about how this
        is all working, please feel free to reach out to either of us, and we will be more than happy to answer your
        questions as best as we can.
