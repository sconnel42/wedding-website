      <p>
        As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we made the decision to postpone our wedding reception from our
        original date (October 10th, 2020) to 2021 instead. We did still have a small ceremony on the original
        day (pictures below!), though we still haven't done the traditional "reception" part of the wedding. As a
        result, there will just be a reception on the October 30th, 2021, starting with the cocktail hour at 6pm.
        This will be followed by dinner and dancing, so please let us know if you have any dietary restrictions.
        Look for an RSVP coming in the mail, if you haven't recieved it yet. We are looking forward to celebrating
        with you all!
