Our first time meeting\n      one another was when we were playing Apples to Apples with friends. In that fall, we had a few classes together and\n      became really good friends. The following spring, the we were both acting in the school musical of Wizard of Oz,\n      and it became very clear that we didn't want to just stay friends, and we've been together ever since.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This hasn't been without difficulties though. Due to different interests in pursueing higher education, we decided\n      to have a long distance relationship, with Becca in Big Rapids, MI and Sean in Champaign, IL. Over the years, we\n      figured out how to best communicate over this distance and found ourselves truly understanding the phrase \"Distance\n      makes the heart grow fonder\".\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      However, being long distance doesn't mean that we didn't go on adventures together. On the contrary, we've\n      explored many cities together, including Chicago, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Colombus,\n      Toronto, and Las Vegas. We've been to other countries together, including Mexico, Dominican Rupublic, Ireland,\n      Germany, and Austria. We've also done a great deal of outdoor activities together, including skiing, kayaking,\n      ziplining, backpacking, spelunking, white-water rafting, and hiking.\n\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This life has been great, but eventually all of this being apart became unfulfilling and the desire for the end of\n      the long distance because much stronger. Now we have decided to embark on the wonderful adventure of marriage. So\n      please, join us in closing the chapter of dating and long distance, and starting the new chapter of marriage and all\n      of the joys and difficulties that come with it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This page has all of the details for the wedding, which you can access through the links at the top of the page. Thank\n      you for the support that you provided in our lives so far, and we look forward to celebrating with you on our wedding day!\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
